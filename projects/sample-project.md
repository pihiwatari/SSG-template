## How to work with your friends, if they're just starting their project? Just share what you can do to help them.

I and my wife met with some friends who have an idea for their new business, a Japanese food catering service. So, they invited me to try some of the food (delicious btw!).

We chatted for a couple of hours about how their project was going, and then they ask us to create an interior design concept for them, to which we agreed. I was given the task to make some renders that begin with the 2D layout, my wife [@nebu_hime](https://www.instagram.com/nebu_hime/?hl=es-la) was responsible for that part.

Then I modeled every item you see in the final render using some reference images provided by our friends.

And this is the final result:
