### Who am I?

Well, I dedicate most of my time creating 3D models, mostly using Rhinoceros 3D, Grasshopper and Blender. On my spare time I mostly play videogames (mainly skyrim and fallout), share some time with my family and petting my dogs, as well as studying web development to improve my skills.
I have a degree on Industrial Design, which allows me to leverage design fundamentals into my work in Additive Manufacturing and web development.

I wanted to share more about me and my work, that's why i've created this website.
