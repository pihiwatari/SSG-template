## Professional experience

I've worked in different professional fields, from CAD drafting for Additive Manufacturing to video editing or motion graphics, and web development, but most of my experience is focused on 3D modeling using **Rhinoceros**, **Grasshopper,** and **Blender**.

## Education

**2017 - 2021**

Since 2017, I have started to learn online using many of the resources available (Youtube, Udemy, etc.), from Web development to emotional intelligence. I really believe that obtaining knowledge from many different sources gives you a better perspective from how other people learn and share its knowledge.

**2012 - 2015**

 Industrial Design Degree at Universidad de Guadalajara
